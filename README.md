# Theatre case duration prediction

### Status
This project is currently work in progress.

### About the project
Key to maximising this session utilisation is the ability to accurately predict the duration of surgical cases at the time of booking (around one month in advance). As well as allowing sessions to be more optimally filled, this may enable booking staff to rebook cancelled sessions at short notice.

There are several published studies which indicate accuarte predictions of case durations are obtainable by machine learning approaches:

* [Bartek et al (2019)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31310851/)
* [Kendale et al (2023)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11041482/)
